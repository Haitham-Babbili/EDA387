l.a.1   Both of them get a response immediately.
        Both of the client sockets are established and owned by the server proccess.  

l.a.2
        Min time to connect is similar 0.55 ms compared to the old value of 0.75 ms
        Max time to connect was a large difference 3.51 ms compared to the old value of 3000 ms
        Averge time to connect was a large differece 1.31 ms compared to the old value of 1559 ms
        This is to be expected since the iterative server had to process all the messages of a client before it would handle a connection. The concurrent server accepts connections simultaneously as it process messages.
        Min RTT is 2902 compared to the old 293 ms
        Max RTT is 3671 compared to the old 7836 ms
        Average RTT is 3402 compared to the old 3639 ms
        The conncurrent server managed to handle all the 100 clients while the iterative server caused timeouts and there were only 34 clients that completed the simulation. 
        The much min lower RTT in the iterative server is the result of only handling 1 client at a time.

l.a.3
        No it is not possible to block the server.
